If you love selfies, you’re in for a treat!
This Selfie Studio comes with professional photography equipment
Like lights, camera, props, different backgrounds, and a remote for self timer
that is sure to level up your selfie game!

Taking the selfie itself takes some getting used to since the camera is in front while the mirror is on the left side. It’s a little challenging to position yourself from time to time.
Nakakahiya pa magpose… haha!
But after a few tries, you’ll get the hang of it.

# space

Shots that may seem awkward or weird in reality can actually look amazing in photos, so just have fun and explore different poses and angles.
Should you run out of artistic shot ideas, they have pegs that you can get inspo from on the side so you need not worry.

Take your whole barkada, your pets, your jowa, your family, or kapitbahay to this selfie studio
and make memories that come out in printed film strips, polaroid or post cards.
Soft copies can be sent to you so you can print the photos that didn’t make it to the cut!

The experience itself is interesting since this selfie studio isn’t really a thing until now.
