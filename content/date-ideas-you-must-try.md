## 1) Pat‚Äôs Putt Indoor Mini Golf

Even if you‚Äôve never tried mini golf, playing with your significant other
can be a fun and interesting experience.
Once you enter the room, you will be greeted by the attractive neon lights that shine in the dark.
Upon entry, you can pay the fees and you‚Äôll be given
A putter and a ball each for you and your partner.
There are more or less 20 layouts, starting from easy to challenging.
You can bet against your date to see who gets to sink the ball in the hole with the least strokes. Loser pays for merienda‚Ä¶ or dinner!

# space

When that‚Äôs done there are also other games you can play such as:

- giant tictactoe
- giant jenga
- sack throw
- under the table football
- giant "beer" pongg (minus the beer)

# space

With so many things to do for 2 hours,
You and your partner are sure to have a blast!

If you get hungry, you can have snacks from their diner or check out the food court right outside Pat‚Äôs Putt!

## 2) Decathlon

Decathlon may not be your typical date place, but you definitely can!
After matching with a potential partner on Bumble, we decided to finally meet after 3 weeks of non-stop talking. Since we both knew how to play ping pong, we decided to have our first match at Decathlon! Haha!
No entrance fees except for parking and we played about 2-3 rounds of ping pong and
whoever lost had to buy dinner at Burger King. It was a casual date, nothing extravagant or serious and it was fun!
No expectation really but the goal was to get to know each other and bonding over playing the sport we love.
It is also nice to show your competitive side even on the first date. Bawal mapikon kahit talo. Haha!

Hey if table tennis isn‚Äôt your thing, you can try basketball, bow and arrow, or if you guys are looking to buy sports or exercise equipment, then this would be a great way to get to know each other while shopping. :)

These are just some of my date ideas‚Ä¶ but at the end of it all, it‚Äôs not what you do or where you are but it‚Äôs who you;re with that matters. Talking over a cup of coffee or even a burger at Jollibee can be magical if you make it so. :)
