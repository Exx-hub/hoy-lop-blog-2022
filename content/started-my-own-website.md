## I Started My Own Simple Website For Only P5,000, And You Could Too!

It may be hard to believe since websites are known to be expensive.
Of course there are free ones,
but more often than not, they look dead…
they’re lifeless that people wouldn’t want to stay for long,
since they’re not visually appealing…
unless you have a very catchy headline or a gimmick in
your landing page then maybe, they will stay a little longer.

What would make them stay?
Good Design, Layout and Content.
but if you go the free route,
expect the design and layout options to be limited.

Even the paid ones are limited…
I actually paid $8 monthly for an upgrade of a website from a free plan
only to abandon it all together a few months later.
